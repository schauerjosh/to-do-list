# Coverage Reports

This folder contains code coverage reports generated by Jest after running unit tests.

- `lcov.info` — Raw coverage data
- `lcov-report/` — HTML report (open `index.html` in your browser)

Coverage is expected to be 100%. If not, review and update tests as needed.

This folder is auto-generated and can be safely deleted/regenerated.
