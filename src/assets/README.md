# Assets & Public Files

- `src/assets/` — Contains static assets used in the app (e.g., `react.svg`).
- `public/` — Contains static files served at the root (e.g., `vite.svg`).

You can add new images, icons, or other static files here as needed. Reference them in your React components or HTML as appropriate.

For questions about asset usage, see the code in `App.jsx` or contact the project maintainer.
